# Verasion-Proposal
Proposal for upcoming implementaion of enhancing CORIM support for [Verasion/services](https://github.com/veraison/services)
# Overview

1. Introduction

The Veraison project provides a framework for remote attestation, enabling verification of the integrity and authenticity of software and hardware components. A critical aspect of this framework is the use of Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIMs), which encapsulate reference values and endorsements necessary for attestation. To enhance security and trust, especially in collaborative environments, supporting multi-signature CoRIMs is essential. This document outlines a comprehensive plan to integrate multi-signature support into Veraison services, ensuring compliance with COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption) standards as specified in RFC 8152.

2. Background

2.1. CoRIM Overview

CoRIMs are standardized data structures that convey reference integrity measurements and endorsements. They play a pivotal role in the attestation process by providing verifiable information about the expected state of a device or component.

2.2. COSE and RFC 8152

COSE defines a framework for securing CBOR-encoded data, including support for signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption. RFC 8152 specifies the structures and processes for applying these security services to CBOR data.

2.3. Multi-Signature Support

Multi-signature mechanisms require multiple parties to sign a document or transaction, enhancing security by distributing trust. In the context of CoRIMs, multi-signature support ensures that multiple entities can endorse a manifest, providing a higher assurance level for the attestation process.

3. Objectives

Enhance Security: Implement multi-signature support to ensure that CoRIMs are endorsed by multiple trusted entities, reducing the risk of single points of failure.

Standards Compliance: Ensure that the implementation adheres to COSE standards as outlined in RFC 8152, facilitating interoperability and consistency.

Seamless Integration: Incorporate multi-signature support into existing Veraison services without disrupting current functionalities.

4. Implementation Plan

4.1. Analysis and Design

Review COSE Structures: Conduct an in-depth analysis of COSE structures related to multi-signature support, focusing on the 'COSE_Sign' and 'COSE_Signature' objects as defined in RFC 8152.

Define CoRIM Extensions: Determine necessary extensions to the current CoRIM schema to accommodate multiple signatures, ensuring alignment with existing standards and practices.

Security Considerations: Assess potential security implications, including key management, signature validation order, and the impact on the overall trust model.

4.2. Development

Extend CoRIM Schema: Modify the CoRIM data model to include fields for multiple signatures, ensuring backward compatibility with existing single-signature implementations.

Implement Multi-Signature Handling: Develop functionality within Veraison services to process CoRIMs with multiple signatures, including:

Signature Aggregation: Combine multiple signatures into a single CoRIM structure.

Signature Validation: Verify each signature against the corresponding public key, ensuring that all required endorsements are present and valid.

Update Provisioning and Verification Services: Enhance existing services to support the creation, distribution, and validation of multi-signature CoRIMs.

4.3. Testing and Validation

Unit Testing: Develop comprehensive tests for individual components handling multi-signature CoRIMs to ensure correctness and robustness.

Integration Testing: Conduct end-to-end tests to validate the interaction between different Veraison services when processing multi-signature CoRIMs.

Compliance Testing: Ensure that the implementation meets all relevant COSE standards as specified in RFC 8152, using standardized test vectors where available.

4.4. Documentation and Training

Update Documentation: Revise existing documentation to reflect the new multi-signature capabilities, including API references, data models, and usage guidelines.

Develop Training Materials: Create resources to assist users and developers in understanding and utilizing the new features effectively.

5. Integration with Security Standards

COSE Compliance: Ensure that all cryptographic operations related to multi-signature support adhere strictly to COSE standards, promoting interoperability and security.

Key Management: Implement robust key management practices, including secure storage, rotation, and revocation mechanisms, to support multi-signature operations.

Audit and Logging: Enhance logging mechanisms to provide detailed records of multi-signature processing activities, facilitating auditing and troubleshooting.

6. Timeline and Milestones

7. Risk Management

Compatibility Issues: Mitigate potential compatibility problems by ensuring backward compatibility and providing clear migration paths for existing users.

Security Vulnerabilities: Address potential security risks through thorough testing, code reviews, and adherence to best practices in cryptographic implementations.

Resource Constraints: Allocate sufficient resources and adjust timelines as necessary to accommodate the complexity of implementing multi-signature support.

8. Conclusion

Integrating multi-signature CoRIM support into Veraison services represents a significant enhancement in the security and trustworthiness of the attestation process. By adhering to COSE standards as specified in RFC 8152 and following the comprehensive plan outlined above, Veraison can provide robust support for multi-signature CoRIMs, meeting the
